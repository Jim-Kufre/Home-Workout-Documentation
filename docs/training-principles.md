# Fitness Principles Behind the Home Workout App

## Summary
The Home Workout App is based on well-known training principles used in bodyweight fitness and home training. The routines are structured to build strength, flexibility, and consistency over time.

## Key Fitness Principles
- **Progressive Overload**  
  The app is created in a way that gradually increases the intensity and duration of workouts as users progress.

- **Consistency Over Intensity**  
  Short, daily routines are better for long-term results than extreme workouts once a week.

- **Full-Body Engagement**  
  Most routines combine upper body, core, and lower body movement patterns.

- **No Equipments**  
  Exercises are selected for their ability to produce results using only body weight.

## Benefits of This Approach
- Accessible to more people
- Safer for beginners
- Encourages daily movement
- Builds habits, not just muscle

## Example
A user may start with 10 push-ups and 15 squats daily. After 2 weeks, the app suggests 15 push-ups and 25 squats, based on performance feedback.
