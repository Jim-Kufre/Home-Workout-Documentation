## Example
James had been feeling his core muscles needed more attention, so he decided to try an abs workout in the Home Workout App. After signing in, he tapped Training on the bottom navigation bar. As he scrolled through the list of muscle groups, he found Abs and selected it. The app displayed three difficulty options â€” Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced. James chose Intermediate, wanting a challenge without pushing too far. Once he tapped Start, the workout session for intermediate-level abs appeared, complete with a set of targeted exercises and timers for each. Motivated, James began his first set, following along with the guided instructions on the screen.
