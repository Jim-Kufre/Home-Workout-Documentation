## About Me
I’m Jim Kufre, a dedicated Technical Writer specializing in software documentation. I create clear, concise, and user-focused content that helps users navigate and understand softwares workings with ease using the DITA topic model (Concept, Task, Reference).  
This repo is part of my portfolio where I demonstrate how to document real or sample software products clearly and effectively.
